\section{Bluetooth}
The technology came from an association from different company led by Ericsson (SIG - Special Interest Group). The name came from the danish king Harold I whose tooth was colored in war due to blueberries and the symbol came from the initials of King Harold ("K" and "H"). 

\subsection{Protocol}
It was bulit for short range communicaton (1-100 m) and it should be enerygy efficient as the purpose is to use it for portable devices. Seven workin groups participated on this huge project:
\begin{itemize}
\item G.1 AIr interface: Bluetooth radio(carrier-generation, modulation coding, power control)
\item G2 Software: Aim to make the protocol low-power based
\item G.3 Interoperability: Define user profiles for communication with other devices
\end{itemize}
There are some requirement consideration as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Transmission rates up to 1 Mbps
\item Energy efficiency: battery energy saving when data is not tx
\item No infrastructure is needed
\item Size should be mall for radio devices. For instance we have small nodes that are important for monitoring people movements
\item Utilization cost: it uses an unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM band so we don't have to pay to use this frequency band
\item Monetary cost: not so high, quite cheap
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Physical layer}
There are three power classes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Class 1: Short range (1m), low power (1mW )
\item Medium range (10m) and power close to 4mW
\item Higher range (100m) and power equal to 100mW
\end{enumerate}
There are 3 basic configuration/functionalities
\begin{itemize}
\item Basic Rate (BR)
\item Enhanced data rate (EDR)
\item Low Energy (LE)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Channel access}
How can nodes communcicate? We have a frequency-hopping/time-division duplex scheme (FH-TDD) meaning We have a frequency-hopping spread spectrum and a time divsion scheme. Rx and Tx shared the frequency and at each transmission slot we have to have tx and rx syncrohnized.

Available bandwidth is spitted into $N:b$ sub-bands and the overall bandwisth is cose to 83.5MHz whereas the numebr of sub-bands or channels are 79 for USA and 23 for Japand. 
The carrier frequency can ben 2.402.GHZ + kMHz for k = 0,1,..78. Remeber that at each time slot we have a carrier frequency specified.

Bluetooth adopt an AFH that avoid overlapping with other non-hopping ISM systems that means that we skip some frequencies. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Guard itnervals: 2.2.5 MHz
\item Hopping rate: 1600 hops/s so that the time between hops (slot duration) is 625 microseconds
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{COmmunication modes}
COmmunciation modes can be 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Point to point
: 1 master, 1 slave. Master sets hopping sequence and cock, slave sycnronizes (clock and hopping sequence)
\item Point-to-multipoint (piconet): 1 master, up to 7 slaves. Master sets hopping sequence followed by all slaves
\item Multipoint-to-Multipoint (scatternet):
\begin{itemize}
\item connect multiple piconets
\item Three ways t interconnect piconets 
\begin{itemize}
\item Master-to-Master if masters are neighbors (one of them becomes slave of the other)
\item Slave as gateways
\item Intermediate gateways if two slaves of two masters are neighbors. New piconets include the two slaves 
\end{itemize}
\item DIfferent piconets have different frequency hopping scheme
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
Piconet formation is made by a 2-step procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Device discovery: master inquires device
\item Link establishment: negotation phase
\end{enumerate}

The start topology implies that slave-slave communciaton can go through only the master observation. 

\paragraph{Device discovery}
Master sends inquiring packs to the device, asking user to identify themselves and provide info about their clock. Thre's also the pre-defined inquiry hopping sequence and it is a 312.5 micorsecond sequence (twice hopping rate).

At the same time the candidate slave carries its own frequency carrier and it is very slow (1..28second) so it adopt to the master's one very slowsly. 
And that point, when they're syncronized, master and candidate slave cna meet and slave sends back to master a frequency-hopping sncronization pck (FHS) with ifo about its system clock. 

Inquirer invites a new node to hjoin the piconet (paging) and then the master sends another FHS with frequency hipping sequence thatallow a new slave to adopt to it. 

\paragraph{Link Layer}
Strict schedule of transmistting packet: time axis is divided into slot with boundaries set by the master because master set the clock information, the clocking sequence and hte boundaries of the slots. 
Slave suncrnized on boundariees. Once they're syncornized slave and master can communciate and exchange packs.

Packets transmission is performed thorugh time division duplex: we can have a single slot packet (at most one packets in each transmission slot). Master start transmitting at \emph{even} numberred tx slots while slave do that in \emph{odd} ones. 

Single-slot pc are 27 bytes of data. One pck every 2 slots tha timplies a step of 1250 microsecond. Transmission rate is172.8 kbps (unidirection, uplink or downlink). Multi-slot packet can be 183 (three slots) or 339 (five slots) bytes and the transmission rates can be585.6kbps or 723.2 kbps. 

With multi-slot pck the carrier frquency is kept unchanged during the transmission because we need to have a stable communication. 

\paragraph{Transmission modes}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sychronous connection-oriented (SCO): the amster assign the trasnsmission slot to the slaves periodically. This can b a good idea for data flow at regualr itnervals
\item Asynchronous connectionless (ACL) link: master polls a given slave (ask a slave to send infos at some poit) whenever an event occurs, e.g master has to send data to it.
\end{enumerate}
These 2 kind of linsk could be use together at the same time so the master can allocated idiffernet can of links for different slve s. 

ARQ scheme is used in Bluetooth when we have some error and it can help to have retransmission of corrupted packets. It goes from master to the slaves or viceversa. 

\paragraph{Piconet scheduling}
In the piconet we can have differen t scheduling scheme 
\begin{itemize}
\item Pure Round Robin (PRR): each slave is polled one/cycle (cycle = time taken for serving all slaves). the Max delay is bounded, but waste of resources in case no data are available at some slaves
\item Limited Round Robin: as PRR, multiple slots could be allocated for each slav. Increased throughput but still resources waste. 
\item Exhaustive Round Robin: slaves are polled until they have data to send. Further increase of throughput but possible unfairness
\item Adaptive Round Robin: unloaded slaves could be skipped. Needs for priority and traffic control schemes. Possible delays for unloaded users. 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Power Modes}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Active: slave always on and listening to all transmission slots. Max responsiveness, but highest power consumption. Nodes are all the time active
\item Sniff: Slave periodically active at regular intervals with the agree with the master. SLave checks for polling message by the maser, otherwise puts rdio to sleep. Slaves must keep synchronization with the master and the rest of the tine they can save energy, but to do so they're less responsive in case of unscheduled polling
\item Hold: slave \textbf{previously} agree with the master to stop listening to channel for specific amount of time  s the nodes can save even more energy compare to the sniff modes. 
\item Park: Nodes that are not in active/sniff/hold states that are no longer considered as piconet members. They still have to maintain synchronism with the master and periodically listen to it. If they want to transmit again they have to perform another phase of exchanging information as it were the first communication between them two. This kind of nodes are called \emph{parked users}. Energy savings is good and each piconet can have at most 1 master, 7 members and 25 parked users.  
\item Standby: user no longer needs to maintain synchronism and negotiation phase is required before starting a new communication. 
\item Other energy saving mechanisms implemented int he Bluetooth as for a slave to ask the master to adjust transmission power in order to keep at minimum error-free communication. 
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Open Issues}
\begin{itemize}
\item Automatic network formation is not supported a
\item If the master moves away, network collapses so  the dynamic of the network should change by this
\item Starting up new connection requires some time like 5s (quite high interval) due to channel and page scanning
\item While a node is in Inquiry mode, if there was some transmission ongoing it will be interrupted by the inquiring set up
\item Inquiry fails if both devices are in inquiry state
\item Communication between piconet (scatternet) is defined mostly as proprietary solutions (no standards)
\item Support for efficient multicast is missing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bluetooth LW Energy - BLE}
This represent an implementation of the Bluetooth has some common feature with the main protocol still performing other differences. As in the Bluetooth there is the implementation of device discovery, connection establishment, connection mechanisms with the purpose of having low energy solution and cheaper solutions for portable device. 

Main feature can be represented as follow:
\begin{itemize}
\item 2.4GHz ISM, 40RF channels
\item Bandwidth: 2 MHz
\item Spread spectrum: AFH
\item Multiple access: FDMA and TDMA
\begin{itemize}
\item FDMA: 40 channels = 3 advertising + 37 data
\item TDMA: polling-based data tx (master-slaves)
\item Piconet (master determines hop interval and hopping pattern for 37 channels)
\end{itemize}
\item 2 Phy channels:
\begin{enumerate}
\item LE advertising: is a broadcast channel for discovery, interaction of devices prior connection and the communication could be establish with every number of devices. This has a short duration though. 
\item LE piconet channel: it perform communication between connected devices, active physical link is a master-slave communication link (we can't perform scatternet communication as in Bluetooth) and the access is controlled by the master. Slaves cannot have > 1 active links with master   
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Access}
Insert figure
\paragraph{Logical Topology}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{red}{'Gna faccio più raga}
\item Slaves connected on same master do not share physical channel 
\end{itemize}
So BLE represents an energy-efficient alternative to original standard
